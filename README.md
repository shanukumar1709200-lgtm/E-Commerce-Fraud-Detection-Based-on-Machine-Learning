# E-Commerce-Fraud-Detection-Based-on-Machine-Learning
The project titled "E-Commerce Fraud Detection Based on Machine Learning" addresses the critical challenge of identifying fraudulent transactions in e-commerce platforms. Developed using Python for backend processing and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend interface, the system is integrated within the Flask web framework to deliver a responsive and interactive user experience.
The project leverages two advanced machine learning models: a Stacking Classifier and an XGB Classifier. The Stacking Classifier achieves an impressive train accuracy of 100% and a test accuracy of 99%, while the XGB Classifier attains a train accuracy of 96% and a test accuracy of 95%. These high performance metrics underscore the models' effectiveness in distinguishing between legitimate and fraudulent transactions.
The dataset utilized comprises 23,634 synthetic records generated through Python's Faker library, enriched with custom logic to emulate realistic transaction patterns and fraudulent scenarios. The dataset includes 16 features such as Transaction ID, Customer ID, Transaction Amount, Payment Method, and a binary indicator for fraudulent activity, among others. These features collectively capture the intricacies of transaction behaviors and customer profiles, enabling robust fraud detection.
The project's results demonstrate the potential of machine learning techniques in enhancing security and trust in e-commerce environments, providing a powerful tool for preventing financial loss due to fraudulent activities.
